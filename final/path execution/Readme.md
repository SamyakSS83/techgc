# IK Simulation using SimOMPL Planner

# Description
This folder contains simulations demonstrating Inverse Kinematics (IK) using SimOMPL planner. The simulation shows path planning and object manipulation with collision avoidance.

# Contents
Path planning demonstrations
Collision avoidance scenarios
Target position tracking
Path existence verification
Object manipulation examples

# Implementation
OMPL planner computes collision-free paths
Real-time path planning based on target movement
Path feasibility checking enabled
Collision detection and avoidance active throughout motion
Automatic path recomputation when target moves

# Features
Automated collision-free path generation
Real-time path planning and execution
Path existence verification
Complete collision avoidance system
Dynamic target tracking and replanning
Visualization of computed paths
Feedback when no valid path exists

# Additional Information
Simulation runs in CoppeliaSim environment
Path planning occurs in real-time as target moves
System automatically detects and avoids obstacles
Clear visualization of planned paths
Feedback system for path planning status
