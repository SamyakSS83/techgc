# ARM Movement Simulation Project

# Overview
This project demonstrates arm movement simulation using MATLAB and CoppeliaSim integration. The simulation allows users to observe and control robotic arm movements through a MATLAB interface.

# Prerequisites
- MATLAB (any recent version)
- CoppeliaSim Edu/Pro
- CoppeliaSim Remote API files for MATLAB

# Installation

## CoppeliaSim Setup
1. Download and install CoppeliaSim from the official website if not already installed
2. Ensure you have the required simulation API files
3. If API files are missing, download them from the official CoppeliaSim website

## MATLAB Configuration
1. Add the simulation files to your MATLAB path
2. Include all required API files in your working directory
3. Verify that all dependencies are properly configured

# Execution Steps

## Initial Setup
1. Launch MATLAB
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Add all project files to MATLAB path

## Running the Simulation
1. Open CoppeliaSim
2. Load the desired scene file
3. Start the simulation in CoppeliaSim
4. Wait for the connection to establish
5. Execute the MATLAB script
6. The arm movement simulation will begin

# Customization
- Different scenes can be executed based on requirements
- Parameters can be modified in the MATLAB script
- Various movement patterns can be implemented

# Troubleshooting
- Ensure all paths are correctly set in MATLAB
- Verify CoppeliaSim is running before executing MATLAB script
- Check if the connection is properly established
- Confirm all required API files are present

# Support
For any mismatch of version , appropriate file can be downloaded from official coppeliasim website(however we have provided most dependencies within our submission)
